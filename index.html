        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m part of the Vulnerability, Accessibility, Inclusion & Bereavements team at Monzo, where I’m passionate about creating a more inclusive and accessible world. My work involves developing strategies that support vulnerable individuals and ensure everyone feels valued, especially during challenging times like bereavement.
            
           <p>
            I also volunteer as a Panel Member at Children's Hearings Scotland, where I’m dedicated to making a difference in the lives of young people, ensuring their voices are heard and respected.
           </p>
            <p>
                Beyond work, I love going to concerts, diving into true crime stories, all things pugs, and exploring new foodie adventures. Let’s connect and collaborate!</p>
